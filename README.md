## Inspiration
Climate change, global warming, deforestation, and extinction are all on the global agenda at any given moment. 
It is generally acknowledged that global action is needed to resolve some of the most serious environmental issues exacerbated by human activity's adverse effects.

AR/VR in particular, has the potential to contribute to sustainability both directly by making certain processes sustainable, and indirectly by encouraging people to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. 

The inherent immersiveness of VR combined with the realism of AR can help us connect with people at a visceral level, thereby highlighting the importance of sustainable living.

## What it does
AREarth is a cross platform web app that can be used for students/professional to interactively learn about the environmental/geographical processes, that helps to educate people about the worldwide effects of climate change through interactive storytelling, in ways that are more engaging and persuasive than standard approaches.

## How we built it
The project is built using `AR.js` which helps to develop cross platform Web AR/VR experience. The reason for choosing `AR.js` is it's

- Very fast
- Built on Web

The front end is built using `react.js`. It is hosted on github pages for live demo.

## Challenges we ran into
Being new to AR the terminologies were difficult to understand, however articles and tutorials helped me to uvercome the difficulties. Hosting the web demo was a little hustle, however github pages came to my rescue.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are super happy and proud that we could bring our idea of using AR in creating environmental awareness. We were so happy that we made a whole finished product.


## What we learned
Being new to AR , it was difficult to understand the theory and working principles of AR/VR technology. However this project helped in understanding the underlying concepts. What was magic for me a days ago is now science ðŸ˜›.


## What's next for AREarth
Currently it uses stored data of various environmental conditions/location. Streaming live data from around the globe is the next great thing happening for **AREarth**.

Besides that it will also support virtual scene/location viewing (e.g. Viewing the amazon rain forest).
